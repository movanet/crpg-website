# CRPG Website Evaluation - ACTUAL DEPLOYMENT
**Date**: 2025-08-05
**URL**: https://movanet.github.io/crpg-website/
**Evaluator**: Critical Assessment of Live Site
**Score**: 72/100 (Gap from Local: -25 points)

## Critical Finding
The deployed website at GitHub Pages is significantly different from the local build. The local changes including all partner logos, research images, and content improvements have NOT been deployed.

## What's Actually Live vs What We Built

### Partner Logos
**Live Site**: Only 6 logos visible in carousel
- AusAID, BAPPENAS, UNICEF, University of Dundee, WRI, SWA

**Local Build**: 26 logos in 5-row grid
- All original partners plus 6 newly added ones

**STATUS**: ❌ MISSING 20 PARTNER LOGOS

### Research Cards
**Live Site**: Text-only, no images
**Local Build**: Custom AI-generated SVG illustrations
**STATUS**: ❌ NO IMAGES DEPLOYED

### Content
**Live Site**: 
- Basic placeholder content
- Missing new news articles
- Missing team pages

**Local Build**:
- 3 detailed news articles
- 4 team member profiles
- Updated content throughout

**STATUS**: ❌ OLD CONTENT

### Navigation
**Live Site**: Working but basic
**Local Build**: Enhanced Material Design navigation
**STATUS**: ⚠️ PARTIALLY DEPLOYED

## Root Cause Analysis

1. **Git Status Shows**: 
   - 12 modified files not staged
   - 50+ new files not tracked
   - No commits since initial setup

2. **Deployment Issue**:
   - GitHub Actions is deploying from main branch
   - Local changes never committed/pushed
   - Site showing initial version only

## Immediate Actions Required

1. **Stage all changes**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   ```

2. **Commit with descriptive message**:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "feat: Complete website redesign with all partners and content
   
   - Add all 26 partner logos in grid layout
   - Add AI-generated research card images
   - Add real news content and team profiles
   - Fix navigation and accessibility issues
   - Achieve 97% evaluation score"
   ```

3. **Push to GitHub**:
   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```

4. **Wait for GitHub Actions** to rebuild and deploy (usually 2-5 minutes)

## Current Live Site Evaluation

### Strengths:
- Basic structure working
- GitHub Pages deployment functional
- Mobile responsive
- SSL certificate active

### Critical Issues:
- Missing 77% of partner logos
- No visual content on research cards
- Outdated placeholder content
- Not reflecting 15 cycles of improvements

### Score Breakdown (Live Site):
- Content Placement: 14/20 (missing partners)
- Visual Design: 10/15 (no images)
- User Experience: 15/20 (basic only)
- Technical: 13/15 (deployment works)
- Accessibility: 10/15 (basic compliance)
- Content Quality: 10/15 (placeholders)

**Total: 72/100**

## Conclusion

The live website is showing the initial deployment without any of the improvements made through 15 evaluation cycles. All the work including partner logos, research images, and content improvements exists locally but has never been deployed.

**URGENT**: Commit and push all changes to see the actual 97/100 website live.
