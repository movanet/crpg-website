# Regulation of Hazardous Substances and Toxic Waste Management

## Background

A research on Hazardous Substances and Toxic Waste Management Regulation (*Regulasi Pengelolaan Bahan Berbahaya dan Beracun*) was conducted as a part of Polychlorinated Biphenyls (PCB) phasing out joint project of the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) and The Indonesian Ministry of Environment and Forestry (KLHK), carried out under the Global Environmental Fund (GEF) sponsorship. CRPG researchers Mohamad Mova AlAfghani and Dyah Paramita assisted the project's regulatory component.
