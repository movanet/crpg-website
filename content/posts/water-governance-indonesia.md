CRPG, in collaboration with national and international partners, has released a comprehensive position paper analyzing Indonesia's draft water law. This research provides evidence-based recommendations to ensure sustainable and equitable water resource management.

## Key Findings

The position paper identifies critical areas for improvement in the draft legislation:

1. **Governance Structure**: Need for clearer institutional arrangements and accountability mechanisms
2. **Community Rights**: Stronger protections for traditional water access rights
3. **Environmental Sustainability**: Enhanced provisions for ecosystem protection
4. **Economic Instruments**: Balanced approach to water pricing and cost recovery

## Recommendations

Our multi-stakeholder group recommends:
- Establishing participatory governance mechanisms at all levels
- Integrating climate adaptation measures into water planning
- Ensuring universal access to safe drinking water
- Protecting vulnerable communities from market-based reforms
