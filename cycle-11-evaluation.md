## HONEST ASSESSMENT

**Current State**: FUNCTIONAL BUT NOT EXCEPTIONAL

The site has transformed from a broken prototype to a functional website. It's now usable, accessible, and professional enough for soft launch. However, it still lacks the polish and comprehensive content needed to truly represent CRPG as a leading think tank.

**Ready for Production?**: YES, WITH CAVEATS
- Suitable for beta/soft launch
- Needs content migration before full launch
- Requires backend integration for forms
- Design could be more distinctive

**Estimated Score After 30 Cycles**: 85-90/100 (Achievable)
