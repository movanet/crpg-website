# Australia Indonesia Infrastructure Research Award
## Research Outputs

**The Role of Regulatory Frameworks in Ensuring the Sustainability of Community Based Water and Sanitation**

The Center for Regulation, Policy and Governance (CRPG) in cooperation with the UNESCO Centre for Water Law, Policy and Science, University of Dundee, was awarded the Australia Indonesia Infrastructure Research Project (AIIRA), administered by the Indonesia Infrastructure Initiative ([INDII](http://www.indii.co.id/index.php/en/)).

The Research Project, "*The Role of Regulatory Frameworks in Ensuring The Sustainability of Community-Based Water and Sanitation*" assesses national legislation, policies, regional by laws as well as other regulatory frameworks related to community based water and sanitation. The research project undertakes two field studies, one in East Nusa Tenggara (Maukaro and Pulau Ende — as well as interviews at the City of Ende and Kupang) and East Java (Lamongan — and interviews in Surabaya). Project Outputs and Related Materials can be downloaded in the following links.
