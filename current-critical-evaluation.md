# CRPG Website Critical Evaluation - Current State

## BRUTAL HONESTY ASSESSMENT

### 1. CONTENT INTEGRITY & VISIBILITY: 3/10 (FAIL)
**Critical Failures:**
- ❌ **Mission Statement Hidden**: "We are a group of scholars passionate to make a difference" - Added to markdown but NOT rendering in hero
- ❌ **No Research Papers**: All PDF links are broken/missing
- ❌ **Team Photos Missing**: Zero team member images migrated
- ❌ **Partner Logos**: Only 6 of 20+ partners shown, some 404
- ❌ **Gallery Empty**: Just placeholder text
- ❌ **Publications Page**: Links to non-existent PDFs

**What Works:**
- ✓ Basic page structure exists
- ✓ Some content was migrated to markdown

### 2. VISUAL DESIGN EXECUTION: 4/10 (POOR)
**Critical Issues:**
- ❌ **Logo Path Issues**: Still using relative paths incorrectly
- ❌ **Dark Mode Broken**: White text on white background in places
- ❌ **No Visual Hierarchy**: Everything looks the same weight
- ❌ **Generic Design**: Could be any website, no CRPG identity
- ❌ **Mobile Chaos**: Overlapping elements, broken spacing

**What Works:**
- ✓ Colors exist (even if applied wrong)
- ✓ Some Material Design elements

### 3. FUNCTIONALITY & FEATURES: 2/10 (CRITICAL FAIL)
**Completely Broken:**
- ❌ **Search is Fake**: No actual index.json generated
- ❌ **Newsletter Goes Nowhere**: Form has no action/backend
- ❌ **Contact Forms Missing**: No way to contact CRPG
- ❌ **Downloads All 404**: Every PDF link is broken
- ❌ **No Analytics**: Can't track anything
- ❌ **No SEO**: Missing meta tags, sitemap, robots.txt

### 4. TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION: 4/10 (POOR)
**Major Problems:**
- ❌ **Console Errors**: "Cannot read property of undefined"
- ❌ **No Error Boundaries**: One JS error breaks everything
- ❌ **7 Separate CSS Files**: Should be 1-2 max
- ❌ **No Image Optimization**: Loading full-size PNGs
- ❌ **No Caching Headers**: Reloads everything every time

### 5. MOBILE EXPERIENCE: 3/10 (UNUSABLE)
**Broken on Mobile:**
- ❌ **Menu Doesn't Close**: Gets stuck open
- ❌ **Text Too Small**: Need to zoom to read
- ❌ **Horizontal Scroll**: Content overflows screen
- ❌ **Buttons Overlap**: Can't tap what you want
- ❌ **Images Don't Scale**: Massive images on small screens

### 6. ACCESSIBILITY COMPLIANCE: 2/10 (LAWSUIT RISK)
**Legal Liability Issues:**
- ❌ **Contrast Failures**: Multiple WCAG violations
- ❌ **Keyboard Traps**: Can't tab through properly
- ❌ **Missing ARIA**: Screen readers can't understand structure
- ❌ **No Alt Text**: Images meaningless to blind users
- ❌ **Focus Invisible**: Can't see where you are

   - Forms are decorative only
   - Can't download any research

3. **Mobile Catastrophe**
   - Unusable on phones

   - Content cut off

4. **Legal Risks**
   - Accessibility violations
   - No privacy policy
   - No terms of service

## PROFESSIONAL VERDICT

**Status**: ABSOLUTELY NOT READY FOR PRODUCTION

This is a rough prototype at best. Launching this would damage CRPG's reputation as a professional think tank. It looks like a student project, not a serious research institution's website.

**Required Before Launch**:
1. Fix ALL broken functionality
2. Migrate ALL content properly
3. Test on real devices
4. Get legal/accessibility audit
5. Implement actual features, not facades

**Estimated Additional Work**: 200-300 hours minimum
