# CRPG Website Evaluation Report - Cycle 12
**Date**: 2025-08-05
**Evaluator**: Critical Assessment Framework
**Score**: 78/100 (Previous: 61/100)

## Executive Summary
The CRPG website has made significant improvements since the last evaluation. All pages have been successfully migrated, partner logos are properly displayed, and the homepage has been cleaned up per requirements. However, several critical issues remain that prevent achieving the 95% target score.

## Detailed Evaluation

### 1. Content Placement & Hierarchy (16/20)
**Critical Issues:**
- ✅ Partner list text removed from homepage (fixed)
- ✅ All partner logos displayed in grid layout
- ✅ Mission statement visible in hero section
- ❌ **Navigation redundancy**: "Our Works" appears twice in menu (lines 125-134 in public/index.html)
- ❌ **Duplicate skip links**: Two "Skip to main content" links (lines 93 and 185)
- ⚠️ **Hero section appears twice**: Both in header and main content

**Evidence:**
```html
<!-- Line 125-134: Duplicate menu item -->
<li class="list f5 f4-ns fw4 dib pr3">
  <a class="hover-white white-90 no-underline" href="/our-works/" title="Our Works page">
    Our Works
  </a>
</li>
<li class="list f5 f4-ns fw4 dib pr3">
  <a class="hover-white white-90 no-underline" href="/our-works/" title="Our Works page">
    Our Works
  </a>
</li>
```

### 2. Visual Design Excellence (12/15)
**Strengths:**
- ✅ Material Design implementation consistent
- ✅ Theme toggle properly positioned
- ✅ Partner logos with proper hover effects

**Critical Issues:**
- ❌ **Two different navigation systems**: Ananke theme nav + custom Material nav causing visual conflict
- ❌ **Hero content duplication**: Shows in both header and main sections
- ⚠️ **Font inconsistency**: System fonts in inline styles vs Google Fonts in CSS

### 3. User Experience (17/20)
**Strengths:**
- ✅ Search functionality implemented
- ✅ Mobile menu system in place
- ✅ Dark/light theme toggle works

**Critical Issues:**
- ❌ **Confusing dual navigation**: Users see two different menu systems
- ❌ **"About CRPG" button links to non-existent /about/ page** (should be /profile/)
- ⚠️ **Google Analytics still using placeholder ID**: "G-XXXXXXXXXX"

### 4. Technical Implementation (13/15)
**Strengths:**
- ✅ All 69 pages successfully generated
- ✅ SEO meta tags properly implemented
- ✅ Structured data for organization

**Critical Issues:**
- ❌ **Mixed template systems**: Using both Ananke theme and custom layouts causing conflicts
- ❌ **CSS loading order issues**: Inline styles override external CSS
- ⚠️ **No favicon files present** despite links in HTML

### 5. Accessibility Excellence (10/15)
**Strengths:**
- ✅ ARIA labels on interactive elements
- ✅ Skip links implemented (though duplicated)
- ✅ Semantic HTML structure

**Critical Issues:**
- ❌ **Duplicate skip links** confuse screen readers
- ❌ **Two navigation regions** without proper ARIA differentiation
- ❌ **Color contrast in light theme**: Light silver text (#F7F7F7) on white fails WCAG

**Evidence:**
```html
<!-- Line 169-170: Light silver text on white background -->
<h1 class="f2 f-subheadline-l fw2 light-silver mb0 lh-title">
  CRPG: Center for Regulation Policy and Governance
</h1>
```

### 6. Content Quality (10/15)
**Strengths:**
- ✅ All pages migrated from original site
- ✅ Publications with PDFs available
- ✅ Proper content organization

**Critical Issues:**
- ❌ **Broken internal links**: /about/ doesn't exist
- ❌ **Team member pages incomplete**: Only Mohamad Mova has content
- ⚠️ **No actual news/blog content**: Only placeholder posts

## Critical Failures Summary

### SEVERITY 1 - Site Breaking (Must Fix):
1. **Duplicate "Our Works" menu items** - Confuses users
2. **Non-existent /about/ page linked** - 404 error
3. **Two competing navigation systems** - Ananke + Material Design

### SEVERITY 2 - Major Issues:
1. **Duplicate skip links and hero sections**
2. **Light silver text on white** - Fails WCAG contrast
3. **Placeholder Google Analytics ID**
4. **Missing favicon files**

### SEVERITY 3 - Important:
1. **Incomplete team member pages**
2. **No real news content**
3. **CSS conflicts between inline and external styles**

## Immediate Action Required

To achieve 95% score, these must be fixed:

1. **Remove Ananke theme header** - Keep only Material Design navigation
2. **Fix duplicate menu items** - Single "Our Works" entry
3. **Change /about/ to /profile/** in hero buttons
4. **Fix text contrast** - No light silver on white
5. **Remove duplicate skip links**
6. **Add actual favicon files**
7. **Complete team member pages**
8. **Fix CSS loading order**

## Score Breakdown:
- Content Placement: 16/20 (80%)
- Visual Design: 12/15 (80%)
- User Experience: 17/20 (85%)
- Technical: 13/15 (87%)
- Accessibility: 10/15 (67%)
- Content Quality: 10/15 (67%)

**Total: 78/100**

## Path to 95%:
Fixing all Severity 1 issues would add ~10 points (88/100)
Fixing all Severity 2 issues would add ~7 points (95/100)

The site has improved significantly but critical navigation and contrast issues prevent it from being production-ready. The dual navigation system is the most pressing concern.
