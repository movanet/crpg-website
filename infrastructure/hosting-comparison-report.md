## 3. Large Document Hosting Requirements

### PDF and Research Document Considerations

**File Size Limits:**
- GitHub Pages: 100MB per file, 1GB per repository
- Netlify: 100MB per file (can be increased on Pro plans)
- Vercel: 100MB per file limit
- AWS S3: Up to 5TB per object

**Bandwidth Considerations for Think Tank Content:**
- Average policy paper: 2-5MB PDF
- Research reports: 10-50MB with charts/data
- Annual reports: 50-200MB
- Video content: 100MB-2GB per file

**Storage Strategy Recommendations:**
1. **Hybrid Approach**: Host site on Netlify/Vercel, store large documents on AWS S3 with CloudFront
2. **Document Optimization**: Compress PDFs, provide multiple formats (web-optimized PDF, mobile-friendly versions)
3. **Progressive Loading**: Implement lazy loading for document previews
4. **External Integration**: Consider academic repository integration (SSRN, ResearchGate)

### Security Features for Research Documents

**Access Control:**
- Password protection for sensitive reports
- IP-based restrictions for internal documents
- Time-limited access URLs for embargo periods
- Integration with authentication systems

**Content Protection:**
- Watermarking for sensitive documents
- Download tracking and analytics
- Version control for document updates
- Backup and archival strategies

## 4. Security Analysis for Policy Institute

### Baseline Security Requirements

**Essential Security Features:**
- SSL/TLS encryption (all platforms provide)
- DDoS protection (varies by platform)
- Web Application Firewall (WAF)
- Content Security Policy (CSP) headers
- Regular security updates
- Backup and recovery procedures

### Platform Security Comparison

**GitHub Pages**
- Basic security: HTTPS, DDoS protection via GitHub infrastructure
- Limitations: No WAF, limited security headers configuration
- Compliance: SOC 2 Type II, suitable for public content only

**Netlify**
- Enhanced security: DDoS protection, security headers, form spam protection
- Pro features: Password protection, role-based access, audit logs
- Compliance: SOC 2 Type II, GDPR compliant
- Security headers: Automatic HTTPS, configurable headers

**Vercel**
- Security features: DDoS protection, automatic HTTPS, security headers
- Pro features: Password protection, team access controls
- Compliance: SOC 2 Type II, GDPR compliant
- Edge-level security optimizations

**AWS CloudFront**
- Enterprise security: Advanced DDoS protection, WAF integration, Shield Advanced
- Access controls: CloudFront signed URLs, origin access identity
- Compliance: Extensive certifications (FedRAMP, HIPAA, PCI DSS)

### Think Tank Security Recommendations

1. **Minimum Viable Security**: Netlify Pro with security headers and access controls
2. **Enhanced Security**: AWS CloudFront + WAF for sensitive content
3. **Document Classification**: Implement tiered security based on content sensitivity
4. **Monitoring**: Set up security monitoring and incident response procedures

## 5. Cost Analysis and Scalability

### Monthly Cost Projections

#### Scenario 1: Small Think Tank (50 visitors/day, 20GB bandwidth/month)
- **GitHub Pages**: $0
- **Netlify Starter**: $0
- **Vercel Hobby**: $0 (personal use only)
- **AWS S3 + CloudFront**: ~$5-8/month

#### Scenario 2: Medium Think Tank (500 visitors/day, 100GB bandwidth/month)
- **GitHub Pages**: $0 (may hit limits)
- **Netlify Pro**: $19/month
- **Vercel Pro**: $20/month
- **AWS**: ~$15-25/month

#### Scenario 3: Large Think Tank (2000 visitors/day, 500GB bandwidth/month)
- **GitHub Pages**: Not suitable
- **Netlify Pro**: $19/month + overages (~$40-60/month)
- **Vercel Pro**: $20/month + overages (~$50-80/month)
- **AWS**: ~$50-100/month (more predictable scaling)

### Scalability Considerations

**Traffic Growth Patterns:**
- Policy releases: 10-50x traffic spikes
- News cycle correlation: Unpredictable surge patterns
- Research publication cycles: Predictable seasonal increases

**Platform Scaling Characteristics:**
- **GitHub Pages**: Hard limits, no burst capacity
- **Netlify/Vercel**: Automatic scaling with usage-based pricing
- **AWS**: Unlimited scaling with predictable per-GB costs

### Long-term Cost Projections (3-year TCO)

| Platform | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 | Total TCO |
|----------|--------|--------|--------|-----------|
| GitHub Pages | $0 | $0 | $0 | $0 |
| Netlify Pro | $228 | $300 | $400 | $928 |
| Vercel Pro | $240 | $350 | $500 | $1,090 |
| AWS (medium) | $300 | $600 | $900 | $1,800 |
